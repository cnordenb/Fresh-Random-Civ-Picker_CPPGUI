The work to make the code compliant to a well recognised convention is underway and ongoing.
You could tell from the mishmash of function name variants - camel case of CreateTabs() and
snake case of civ_name() that my habit from my early C days with snake case has carried over.
I will work to make my code convention compliant step by step. I keep entries in this document
to keep track of the progress and what I am doing at the moment. The convention I have decided
to use is that of Google's style guide for C++ (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).)

Current goals:
	- Make all function names camel case.
	- make all function names begin with a verb.
